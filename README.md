# Hi üëã My Name Is Sergei Kardashev

## Full-Stack Developer
I'm currently seeking employment opportunities as a front-end developer or full-stack developer.

- 1 year as an HTML+CSS web developer in [Tele2](https://www.tele2.com/) 
- 1.5 years as a freelancer
- 20 years as UI/UX designer and 3 years as product manager in [Tele2](https://www.tele2.com/) and [BeeLine](https://moskva.beeline.ru/en-us/welcome/general-information/)
- üåç I'm based in Phuket, Thailand
- üß† I'm learning TypeScript and SCSS

### Experience 
I've worked for 20+ years in IT and have developed a **unique set of skills in development, design, UX research, and management**. These diverse experiences allow me to effectively communicate with team members, adapting my language to suit each role‚Äîbe it talking about metrics and KPIs with managers or design principles with designers.

### Bio

After obtaining master's degree in engineering, I learned to code from books and courses while working. I started by creating simple websites as a freelancer. 

At [Tele2](https://www.tele2.com/) I developed the Data Shop Service Catalog and created 10+ digests for employees. 

I further polished my skills in front-end development and learned back-end development through the Web Development Professional Training Course at [Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) by [Yandex](https://yandex.eu/) to polish my skills in front-end and learn backend. 


### Motivation
My big goal is to make the planet a better place to live. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. By combining my skills in web development, design, and management, I aim to create impactful and innovative solutions.

Now that I have expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I am eager to put it into practice and create products that enhance lives. I believe that a wheel can be reinvented and that everything should be improved except for cranberry cake. It is perfect as it is.

### Skills Development Plan
I'm a hard-core believer in life-long education. I continue to learn and am passionate about what I do.  Nowadays I'm learning TypeScript and SCSS. Next I'll learn Redux.
